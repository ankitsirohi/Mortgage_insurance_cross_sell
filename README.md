# Mortgage_insurance_cross_sell

A consumer bank with a range of products would like to cross-sell insurance to its consumer base (that is, cross-sell the personal protection insurance (PPI) product to those customers who have a secured or unsecured type of loan, but no PPI productas yet). 
Attached is a sample data set from their customer portfolio containing various fields about their product ownership, credit standing, outstanding amounts, and whether they already have an insurance product (called as PPI / personal protection insurance), if any, the type of PPI product they own.
The bank would like to adopt analytics driven approach applied on this sample data for deciding:
-	Who should they target from the pool of customers that currently do not have a PPI, and
-	What type of PPI product they should be targeting them with..
Using the attached sample data, please come up with your analytics approach, detailing the following in a PowerPoint presentation format:
-	Your understanding of the different data fields
o	Note: No further information is available on data field descriptions etc. You could make smart assumptions about what the fieldsmean, and call out such assumptions.

-	Present snippets of the analytics you performed with the data (feel free to build any model/ models if you think it is relevant, but you donâ€™t have to necessarily build a model. We will be interested in the quality of insights you have to provide)

-	How you would use the results of the analysis in designing a simple, but effective strategy to achieve the goal of cross-sell

-	How would you measure the improvement driven by the approach?
